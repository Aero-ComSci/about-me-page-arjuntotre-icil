       <h3>From the first time I laid my eyes on a computer I knew that I wanted to be involved with its development. It always had interested me how something like that could
         even be created,and that is why I always wanted to learn more. One thing I also learned from my time with computers is that I had a strong love for Video Games.
          My goal for the next few years  is to be able to develop my own video game with its own assets and its own characters that would be made by me and me only. 
          My main goal for the future is being able to get into  a good shool that can fit all my tech needs. If I can I would like to major in Computer Science 
          Since I want to work in the Game Development field. </h3>
       
    
    
        <p>I Am Charismatic, Persistent, Courteus </p>
    
    
    
        <h3>I think my main strengths that may help me in the future are that that I am very persistent. This can help me in the future as
             if my code ever develops problems that i don't know how  to fix, then I could use this strength to continue going even in rough times.
              I think this is mainly shown by my experiences, especially inside of school and in my extracurriculars. There has been many times
             on assignments where i was completely stuck but I got back up and kept trying to do my best, until i could finnaly complete it.
              Another Skill I have is that I am Charismatic, so I am able to work very well with other people, is especially shown when I do group projects. 
              Lastly, my final skill is that I am am courteus, so I am able to be respectful to the other people around me and that can help me make 
              friends and be a better team worker.</h3>
        
    
        <p> Major Accomplishments?   </p>
    
    
    
        <h3>Although I have yet to gain many major accomplishments during my first year of highschool,
             I am still proud to say that i partook in various activities such as Volleyball,Playing the Guitar, Learning how to
              construct apps and games in my extracurricular coding classes, and learning about generative AI for the future. 
              Im hoping the future is bright and that I can continue to partake in many activities and gain some accomplishments!  </h3>

        <p>My Experience</p>
    
    
    
        <h3>Through the experiences I've been through, such as taking a very hard math class, 
            I learned that taking notes and listening is a key part of obtaining knowledge. 
            In the beginning of the year I did not take many notes and did not listen very well to the teachers instructions, 
            and that led to me geting a pretty bad grade in quarter 1. in quarter 2 on the other hand, I began to realize that 
            a change was needed and I started taking notes and paying attention. This allowed for me to bump my grade up 20% and allowed me to flourish in math. 
        </h3>

        <p>My Experience 2</p>


        <h3>
            Again, I also learned a lot about what it means to have teamwork
            through my presence in team sports such as Volleyball and Basketball. I did not really understand what it meant to have teamwork
             until I first started my volleyball career last year. I realized that what I had 
            been understanding about teamwork before volleyball was not true. 
            I had to rethink what it meant to have teamwork and nowadays I understand that 
            teamwork is you and your team really understanding each other and 
            knowing each others thoughts, and being in sync, compared to just playing the game together.
        </h3>
    
    
        <p>Conclusion</p>
    
    
        <h3>For most of my life I think that I never really had a clear goal. I needed balance but I never strived for it until now. 
            I think one thing i learned over the years that has really stuck with me is how much importance
            balance has in your life. I want to live my life like Spider-Man. I want to balance my life like how Peter Parker 
            balances his life with Spider-Man and his real life. I think that having a clear goal in mind is extremely important
            and especially having something you want to achieve with all your heart is even more impotrant. Without a goal 
            what do you have? Thank you for your time, please continue on my site.
